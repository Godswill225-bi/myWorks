               <h3> Emergency Care </h3>
                <p id="tame">All around the world, acutely ill and injured people seek care every day. First contact health workers manage children and adults with medical, surgical and obstetric emergencies, including injuries, sepsis, heart attacks and strokes, asthma and acute complications of pregnancy. 
                    Many proven health interventions are time dependent. Emergency care is an integrated platform for delivering accessible, quality and time-sensitive health care services for acute illness and injury across the life course. Integrated emergency care services facilitate timely recognition, treatment management and, when needed, continued treatment of the acutely ill at the appropriate level of the health system.
                    
                    Critical care is an ongoing, intensive treatment provided to patients with life-threatening illnesses or injuries that require close, constant monitoring and support. Care is typically delivered in critical care units (e.g. intensive care units or high dependency units). Critically ill patients often need advanced medical equipment and therapies, intravenous medications to support heart function or blood pressure, and continuous monitoring of vital signs.
                    
                    Over half of deaths and over a third of disability in low- and middle-income countries could be addressed by the implementation of effective emergency and critical care. Prioritizing an integrated approach to early recognition, resuscitation, treatment and prevention of complications from acute conditions reduces the morbidity and mortality from a wide range of diseases across the life course.

               <h3> Inpatient Services</h3>
                <p id="jon">Inpatient care is care provided in a hospital or other type of inpatient facility, where you are admitted, and spend at least one night—sometimes more—depending on your condition.
    
                    As an inpatient:
                    
                    You are under the care of doctors, nurses, and other types of health care professionals within a hospital.
                    You are often admitted to a particular service, such as Neurology, Cardiology, Orthopedics, Oncology, General Surgery, etc., depending on what you are being treated for.
                    You may be an inpatient due to surgery, illness, childbirth, or traumatic injury. There are inpatient facilities and hospitals for substance use and mental health illness, as well.
                    Your inpatient stay may have been planned ahead—such as a knee replacement surgery or childbirth.
                    Your stay may have been the result of an emergency or unplanned illness or injury, such as a heart attack or serious car accident.
                    You are in need of medicine, care, monitoring, and medical treatment—the kind that’s provided by around-the-clock medical staff.
                    Once a doctor decides you no longer require inpatient care, you are discharged from the facility. Discharge notes often include instructions to follow up with various doctors, take prescribed medications, and even receive outpatient services, if needed.</p>

                     <h3>Outpatient services </h3>
                    <p id="ton">Outpatient care—the kind that you don’t have to stay in a hospital for—can vary greatly. Other than an annual check-up or blood test, almost any other kind of care can be defined as outpatient. These may be diagnostic tests, treatments, or other types of procedures.
                        Outpatient care may be provided in a hospital, as well as a walk-in clinic, an outpatient surgery center, and even your doctor’s office.</p>
